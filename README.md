# Feed Forward Neural Network with two hidden layers 
This is a console application which is capable of understanding from the given by Mnist dataset of pictures (28x28), to understand the numbers on it using sigmoid Activation function and Backpropagation method in order to improve the accuracy by changing the edges using Chain Rule 
## Functions Used:
### Sigmoid activation function used
